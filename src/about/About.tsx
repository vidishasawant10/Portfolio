          <p>I'm deeply fascinated by the ever-evolving world of Software Engineering and committed to continuous learning and growth. I love learning new things, even outside of my job, and I'm always working on personal projects to get better.</p>
         <p>In my free time, I channel my technical expertise and creative mindset into developing innovative web applications that address complex issues and deliver tangible value to users. I'm proficient in a wide array of technologies, including React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Figma, UI/UX design principles, and AWS. From designing user-friendly interfaces to optimizing performance and ensuring security and reliability, I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.</p>
         <p>I hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science from Pace University, where I gained invaluable academic experience in software development. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, including a challenging Data Warehousing project for my Introduction to Parallel Computing Coursework. In this project, I utilized advanced tools and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Putty, and WinSCP to implement efficient data management solutions.</p>
         <p>Additionally, I have hands-on experience with a diverse range of tools and frameworks, including Cucumber, Cypress, Linux, React Native, and Angular. I've successfully implemented these technologies in various projects, honing my skills and expanding my expertise along the way.</p>
         <p>Currently, I'm actively seeking Full-Time opportunities where I can leverage my extensive skill set and passion for innovation. I invite you to explore my projects and resume to learn more about my experience and qualifications.
